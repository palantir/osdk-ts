## TypeScript Best Practices

- NEVER solve a problem in typescript by using `any` without first asking the user. If you think you need to use `any` then you probably don't understand the problem and need to ask for help

## React Best Practices

- Always put new react components in their own file
- Always create separate React components instead of inline functions

## Project Management

- This project uses pnpm. DO NOT use npm
