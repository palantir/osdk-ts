# OSDK Component Library

> A React component library for building applications on the Ontology SDK (OSDK). Provides data-bound UI components for displaying, editing, and interacting with ontology objects.

## Components

- [Object Table](/components/object-table): High-scale, data-agnostic table for displaying ontology objects with sorting, filtering, and row actions.
- [Object List](/components/object-list): Vertical list view for ontology objects with customizable item rendering.
- [Property Editor](/components/property-editor): Form component for viewing and editing object properties.
- [Filter Bar](/components/filter-bar): Configurable filter interface for narrowing object sets.
- [Action Button](/components/action-button): Button that triggers ontology actions with built-in validation and confirmation.

## Key Concepts

- Object Types: Define the schema and structure of ontology objects.
- Properties: Typed attributes on object types (string, number, date, etc.).
- Filters: Predicates for narrowing object sets by property values.
- Actions: Operations that modify ontology objects with defined parameters and validation.

## Optional

- [Theming](/guides/theming): Customize component appearance via CSS variables and design tokens.
- [Integration](/guides/integration): Connect components to OSDK client instances.
