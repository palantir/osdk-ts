# example-tutorial-todo-aip-app

This project was generated with [`@osdk/create-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@osdk/create-app) from the `tutorial-todo-aip-app` template. It is built against a locally generated SDK and a non-existent Foundry stack, so it is intended for reference purposes only.

To quickly create your own version of this template run the following command and answer the prompts based on your Developer Console application:

```
npm create @osdk/app@latest -- --template tutorial-todo-aip-app
```

Alternatively check out the Developer Console docs for a full guide on creating and deploying frontend applications with the Ontology SDK.
