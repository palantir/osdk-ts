# example-vue

This project was generated with `@osdk/create-app` from the `vue` template. It has been modified to build against a locally generated SDK for demonstration purposes.

To quickly create your own project run the following command and answer the prompts based on your Developer Console application:

```
npm create @osdk/app@latest -- --template vue
```

Alternatively check out the Developer Console docs for a full guide on creating and deploying frontend applications with the Ontology SDK.
