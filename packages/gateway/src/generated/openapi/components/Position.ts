/**
 * GeoJSon fundamental geometry construct.
 *
 * A position is an array of numbers. There MUST be two or more elements.
 * The first two elements are longitude and latitude, precisely in that order and using decimal numbers.
 * Altitude or elevation MAY be included as an optional third element.
 *
 * Implementations SHOULD NOT extend positions beyond three elements
 * because the semantics of extra elements are unspecified and ambiguous.
 * Historically, some implementations have used a fourth element to carry
 * a linear referencing measure (sometimes denoted as "M") or a numerical
 * timestamp, but in most situations a parser will not be able to properly
 * interpret these values. The interpretation and meaning of additional
 * elements is beyond the scope of this specification, and additional
 * elements MAY be ignored by parsers.
