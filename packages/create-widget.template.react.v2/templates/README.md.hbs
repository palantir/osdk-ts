# {{project}}

This project was generated with [`@osdk/create-widget`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@osdk/create-widget) and demonstrates developing a custom widget to be embedded within Foundry UIs such as Workshop. It uses the Ontology SDK package `{{osdkPackage}}` with React on top of Vite. Check out the [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) docs for further configuration.

## Developing

Run the following command or equivalent with your preferred package manager to start a local development server on `http://localhost:8080`:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Development configuration is stored in `.env.development`.

## Deploying

Run the following command or equivalent with your preferred package manager to create a production build of your application:

```sh
npm run build
```

Production configuration is stored in `.env.production`.

A `foundry.config.json` file is included in the root of this project to make deploying to Foundry website hosting with [`@osdk/cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@osdk/cli) easier. If you are not using Foundry website hosting for your application you may delete this file.
