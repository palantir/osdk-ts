# @osdk/seed-compiler

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 6010d45: Migrate @osdk/aip-core, @osdk/foundry-config-json, @osdk/seed-compiler, @osdk/seed-helpers, @osdk/oauth, @osdk/faux, and @osdk/osdk-docs-context to lint with oxlint and format with oxfmt (configured via Ultracite) instead of ESLint and dprint (eleventh increment of the repo-wide oxc migration; the standard libraries). Each package is reformatted with oxfmt, with its newly-surfaced error-level lint rules turned off in a nested oxlint config to keep the change behavior-preserving.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [6010d45]
  - @osdk/seed-helpers@0.19.0

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 08e921c: Bump `foundry-platform-typescript` catalog to 2.63.0 and surface the new CBAC/MANDATORY marking subtype on `ObjectMetadata.Property` via a new `typeMetadata` discriminated-union field. For marking properties, `typeMetadata` is `{ type: "marking"; subtype?: "CBAC" | "MANDATORY" }`, letting consumers distinguish classification-based markings from mandatory markings on object property columns. Future per-`type` metadata should be added as additional variants of `typeMetadata` rather than as new top-level optionals on `Property`.

### Patch Changes

- @osdk/seed-helpers@0.10.0

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 5ff7aa5: Bump `@osdk/foundry.*` and `@osdk/internal.foundry.*` catalog entries from `2.61.0` to `2.63.0`. The OntologyScenarios endpoints now expose a `preview` query-param slot, so `createScenario` and the `EXPERIMENTAL_ScenarioClient` read methods pass `{ preview: true }` directly instead of relying on a fetch-level URL rewrite.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 8965bdf: Bump `@osdk/foundry.*` and `@osdk/internal.foundry.*` catalog entries from `2.57.0` to `2.61.0`. Includes type-fixups for the new `applyScenario` / `scenarioReference` discriminated-union variants and the now-required `QueryParameterV2.required` field.

### Patch Changes

- @osdk/seed-helpers@0.8.0

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 60aff19: Bump `@osdk/foundry.*` and `@osdk/internal.foundry.*` catalog entries from `2.57.0` to `2.61.0`. Includes type-fixups for the new `applyScenario` / `scenarioReference` discriminated-union variants and the now-required `QueryParameterV2.required` field.

### Patch Changes

- @osdk/seed-helpers@0.7.0

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- d6f67f6: add seed data compiler. New `@osdk/seed-helpers` package exports `createSeed` and `SeedBuilder` for declaring typed seed objects and links. New `@osdk/seed-compiler` package compiles all top-level `.mts` files in a directory into a merged seed JSON (sorted by filename for deterministic output) for foundry-cli's local ontology server to load into SQLite on startup. Schema-aware validation (primary-key uniqueness, string format checks for `timestamp`/`date`/`datetime`/`long`/`decimal`) reads from `ontology-metadata.json` produced by the SDK generator, so the same compiler works against both ontology-as-code projects and imported ontologies.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [d6f67f6]
  - @osdk/seed-helpers@0.2.0
