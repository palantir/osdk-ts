# Installation

Once these features are Generally Available, simply update to the latest versions of `@osdk/client` and `@osdk/react` in your project. Currently, they are in beta and require some additional steps.

## 1. Specify the Beta Versions

Using `latest` in npm/yarn/pnpm does not always install the actual latest version, especially when dealing with beta or release-candidate packages. You must specify them explicitly, for example:

```json
"@osdk/client": "^2.2.0-beta.4",
"@osdk/oauth": "^1.0.1",
"@osdk/react": "^0.4.0-beta.2",
```

## 2. Regenerate Your SDK on Foundry

### Access the Developer Console

In the Developer Console for your Foundry, after loading your application, click the "SDK versions" tab on the left navbar. If it is collapsed, it has a tag icon on it.

### Ensure Beta SDK Generation is Enabled

On the SDK versions page, in the top right corner is a "Settings" button. Click it and enable beta features for TypeScript.

### Generate a New Version

Click the blue "Generate new version" button. In the dialog that shows up, make sure that the checkbox for "npm" is checked and that you are on the latest -beta generator. Mine has `2.2.0-beta.3` currently. Then click "Generate" and wait a few seconds.

Note: normally we want the generator version `2.2.0-beta.3` to match the `@osdk/client` version we have in our package.json file. However, in this case, I know that the `2.2.0-beta.3` will work with the `2.2.0-beta.4` `@osdk/client`.

### Update Your package.json

On the SDK versions page, the table shows you your generated sdk version number in the left column. Mine says "0.4.0" so we will update my package.json to reflect that. Note, you need to use your package name, not `@no-caching-app/sdk`.

```json
{
  ...
  "dependencies": {
    ...,
    "@no-caching-app/sdk": "^0.4.0",
    ...
  }
  ...
}
```

# Getting Started

Below is an example using filenames that align with a typical osdk project.

## Configure `<OsdkProvider2/>`

In `main.tsx` (or wherever you call `createRoot`), add an `OsdkProvider2`:

```ts
import { OsdkProvider2 } from "@osdk/react/experimental";
import client from "./client"; // or wherever you created it
```

Then wrap your existing root components with `<OsdkProvider2 client={client}>`:

```ts
ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")!).render(
  <OsdkProvider2 client={client}>
    <RouterProvider router={router} />,
  </OsdkProvider2>,
);
```

## Retrieve Objects

```tsx
import { Todo } from "@my/osdk";

function App() {
  const { data, isLoading } = useOsdkObjects(Todo);

  // If the cache has no existing copy for this query and
  // we are in a loading state then we can just tell the
  // user we are loading
  if (!data && isLoading) {
    return "Loading...";
  }

  return (
    <div>
      {isLoading && <div>Refreshing data</div>}

      {/* Actually render the todos */}
      {data.map(todo => <TodoView todo={todo} />)}
    </div>
  );
}
```

Using a `where` clause:

```ts
const { data, isLoading } = useOsdkObjects(Todo, {
  where: { text: { $startsWith: "cool " } },
});
```

## Render a Single Object

We can either load an object by type and primary key or we can pass an `Osdk.Instance` object we have already loaded to get information like its `isLoading` status.

```tsx
import { Todo } from "@my/osdk";

interface TodoProps {
  todo: Todo.OsdkInstance;
}

function TodoView({ todo }: TodoProps) {
  const { isLoading } = useOsdkObject(todo);
  // or ` const { data, isLoading } = useOsdkObject(Todo, "somePrimaryKey");

  return (
    <div>
      {todo.title}
      {isLoading && "(Loading)"}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Call an Action

{@link useOsdkAction} is the hook we use for apply actions. The hook does not apply the action on page render. Instead it returns an object that lets you invoke `applyAction` in a react callback and render the state of the last/active call.

```tsx
import { $Actions } from "@my/osdk";

function TodoView({ todo }: TodoProps) {
  const { isLoading } = useOsdkObject(todo);
  const { applyAction, error, isPending } = useOsdkAction(
    $Actions.completeTodo,
  );

  const onClick = React.useCallback(() => {
    applyAction({
      todo: todo,
      isComplete: true,
    });
  }, [applyAction, todo]);

  return (
    <div>
      <div>
        {todo.title}
        {todo.isComplete == false && (
          <span>
            <button onClick={onClick} disabled={isPending}>
              Mark Complete
            </button>
          </span>
        )}
        {isPending && "(Applying)"}
      </div>
      {error && (
        <div>
          An error occurred while applying the action:
          <pre>{JSON.stringify(error, null, 2)}</pre>
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Optimistic Updates

With optimistic updates, you can change the internal cache of the ObservationClient while you wait for the action to be performed.

In this case, it allows us to mark the todo as complete even though applying the action to the server has not yet completed.

If the action is successful then the changed objects are automatically reloaded from the server and the optimistic change is removed.

If the action errors, then the changed objects are automatically rolled back to their state prior to the action being performed.

```tsx
// ...

function TodoView({ todo }: TodoProps) {
  const { isLoading, isOptimistic } = useOsdkObject(todo);
  const { applyAction, error, isPending } = useOsdkAction(
    $Actions.completeTodo,
  );

  const onClick = React.useCallback(() => {
    applyAction({
      todo: todo,
      isComplete: true,
    }, {
      optimisticUpdate: (ou) => {
        ou.updateObject(
          todo.$clone({
            isComplete: true,
          }),
        );
      },
    });
  }, [applyAction, todo]);

  return (
    <div>
      {todo.title}
      {todo.isComplete == false && !isOptimistic && (
        <button onClick={onClick} disabled={isPending}>Mark Complete</button>
      )}
      {isPending && "(Saving)"}
      {isLoading && "(Loading)"}
      {isOptimistic && "(Optimistic)"}
    </div>
  );
}
```

# Debugging Issues

## NPM Install Concerns

NOTE: DO NOT DO THIS UNLESS YOU ARE HAVING PROBLEMS.

NPM aggressively tries to prevent you from making mistakes when mixing and matching versions. Generally, this is desirable behavior but can often get in your way when dealing with beta/rc/prerelease packages.

If you are having issues with NPM resolving `peerDependencies` then you may want to add the following to the bottom of your package.json:

```json
"overrides": {
  "@osdk/client": "$@osdk/client",
  "@osdk/oauth": "$@osdk/oauth",
  "@osdk/react": "$@osdk/react"
}
```

This will tell npm to force every usage to the versions we specified in our `dependencies` section, regardless of what those packages' own `dependencies`/`peerDependencies` say.
