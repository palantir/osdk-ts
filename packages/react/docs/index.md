/WARNING

`@osdk/react` is an opinionated library for using OSDK in a react application. It provides a number
of features over using the `@osdk/client` directly:

- **Data Fetching Hooks**: Query objects, links, aggregations, and metadata with automatic caching
- **Real-time Updates**: Stream live data changes via WebSocket with `streamUpdates`
- **Normalized Caching**: Automatic cache invalidation and synchronization
- **Optimistic Updates**: Instant UI feedback with automatic rollback on errors
- **Advanced Querying**: Set operations, link traversal, derived properties, and server-side aggregations
- **Action Management**: Execute and validate actions with full loading/error states
- **Utilities**: Debounce callbacks for efficient event handling
