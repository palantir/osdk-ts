/**
 * Utility function for testing link observation behavior between objects
 *
 * This function provides the following guarantees:
 * - Sets up a link subscription using the Store's observeLinks method
 * - Validates that an initial "loading" state is emitted with empty results
 * - Waits for the link data to be fetched and emitted
 * - Validates the "loaded" state contains the expected linked objects
 * - Returns both the link payload and mock subscription function for further assertions
 *
 * This helper creates a standardized test flow for link observations that:
 * 1. Creates a subscription to observe links from source to target objects
 * 2. Verifies the initial loading state is emitted with empty results
 * 3. Waits for the data loading to complete
 * 4. Verifies the loaded state with the expected linked objects
 * 5. Provides the result objects for additional assertions in tests
 *
 * @typeParam S - The source object type definition
 * @typeParam T - The target object type definition
