# {{project}}

This project was generated with [`@osdk/create-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@osdk/create-app) and demonstrates using the Ontology SDK package `{{osdkPackage}}` with Expo. Check out the [Expo](https://expo.dev) docs for further configuration.

## Settings OAuth & scopes

   Expo project requires a different redirect url setup then standard web applications.
   Make sure you set `http://localhost:8080` without the following path `/auth/callback` in the OAuth & Setting page on your Dev Console applications.
   Similar, when you setup production site using Web Hosing set the redirect url in OAuth & Setting page to something like `https://<SUB-DOMAIN>.<YOUR DOMAIN>.palantirfoundry.com`

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
