/**
 * Gets the difference between a pending blockSetVersionId and the blockSetVersionId it was created from, in the
 * case of a brand new block set this will be empty.
 *
 * The diff is computed at the shape level, providing the severity of each shape diff. Currently the decision of
 * how to aggregate severity is left to the client, but at the shape level it's calculated in the backend so that
 * all clients have a single source of truth.
 *
 * Throws `BlockSetVersionNotFound` if the pending block set does not exist or if the user does not have
 * `marketplace:read-local-marketplace` on the store it is in.
 * Throws `BlockSetVersionNotPending` if the specified pending block set version is not pending.
 * Throws `BlockSetShapesInvalid` if the pending block set shapes are invalid.
 *
 * V1 and V2 compatible: Compatible with pending block sets created with `createBlockSetVersion` and
 * `createBlockSetVersionV2`.
