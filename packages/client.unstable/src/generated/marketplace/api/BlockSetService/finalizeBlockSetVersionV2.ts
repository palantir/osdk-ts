/**
 * Sends a synchronous request to begin finalization of a pending block set version. This also finalizes all the
 * individual blocks in the block set, and eny external recommendations. This locks e.g. any documentation
 * changes and marks the block set version as ready to ship.
 *
 * Use `getBlockSetVersionStatusV2` to track the status during finalization.
 *
 * Throws `BlockSetVersionNotFound` if the block set does not exist or if the user does not have
 * `marketplace:read-local-marketplace` on the store it is in.
 * Throws `EditBlockSetVersionInMarketplacePermissionDenied` if the user does not have
 * `marketplace:edit-block-set` on the store that the block set version is in..
 *
 * Throws `BlockSetVersionNotPending` if the specified block set version is not pending.
 * Throws `BlockSetVersionStatusNotCompatibleWithFinalize` if the status of the pending block set is not able
 * to process a finalize request (`BlockSetVersionStatusResponseV2` is not `idle`).
 * Throws `BlockSetFinalizedWithErroredOutputSpecs` if the pending block set has any output specs that did not
 * successfully materialize.
 * Throws `BlockSetFinalizedWithEmptySpecs` if the block set version has no output specs.
 * Throws `BlockSetVersionConflict` if the finalized semver already exists for the block set and marketplace.
 *
 * V2 compatible: Compatible with pending block sets created with `createBlockSetVersionV2`.
