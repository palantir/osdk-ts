/**
 * This filter analyzes the query string.
 * The output of the analysis of a string are called tokens, for example the string "The Quick Brown Fox"
 * produces the tokens "the", "quick", "brown", "fox" using the default analyzer.
 *
 * An object matches a MultiMatchFilter iff the tokens for the specified query match exactly
 * any of the tokens from values in the properties specified in the PropertySet.
 *
 * For example, a query with "The Quick Brown Fox" for a property with the default analyzer
 * queries for `"the" OR "quick" OR "brown" OR "fox"`, so would match "The brown fox jumped over the fence".
 *
 * Additional Japanese query behavior:
 *
 * Custom tokenization gets applied iff a filter has Japanese query string and uses standard analyzer. If it uses
 * non-standard analyzer, it does not tokenize the string, assuming the given analyzer can handle Japanese query.
 *
 * In the custom tokenization, a sequence of the following characters is considered as one token: Han and
 * Hiragana, Katakana, Alphabets, or numbers. For example, the string "はねだ空港ターミナルA発バス231" produces the
 * tokens "はねだ空港", "ターミナル", "A", "発", "バス", "231" using JapaneseTokenization.
 *
 * Each tokenized string are treated as PhraseFilter, so any multi-token Japanese query string results in
 * AndFilter of PhraseFilters of each token. Also, in tokenized AndFilter, phrase mode for each token
 * PhraseFilter depends on its character type it sets the phrase mode is set following the rules below:
 *
 * - Any token except for the last token is treated with PhraseMatchMode.PHRASE.
 * - If the last token is Han and Hiragana, PhraseMatchMode.PHRASE gets applied to the token.
 * - If the last token is Katakana or Alphanumerics, PhraseMatchMode.PHRASE_PREFIX get applied to the token.
 *
 * If the original PhraseFilter uses both standard analyzer and non-standard analyzer for different properties,
 * it creates a mix of tokenized filters or MultiMatchFilters using provided analyzer for corresponding
 * properties, and it combines them into one filter in Or condition.
