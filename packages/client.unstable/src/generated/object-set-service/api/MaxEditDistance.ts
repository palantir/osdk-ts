/**
 * The maximum distance between words to consider them to be a match.
 *
 * The distance is measured as the minimum number of operations required to change one word into another. Operations consist of insertions,
 * deletions or substitutions of a single character, or transposition of two adjacent characters. (Damerauâ€“Levenshtein distance)
 *
 * The AUTO strategy determines the max edit distance based on the length of the term:
 * - terms of length {0, 1, 2} must match exactly,
 * - terms of length {3, 4, 5} have one edit allowed,
 * - terms longer than 5 have two edits allowed.
 *
 * AUTO should generally be the preferred value for the edit distance.
