# {{project}}

This project was generated with [`@osdk/create-widget`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@osdk/create-widget) and demonstrates developing custom widgets to be embedded within Foundry UIs such as Workshop. It uses React on top of Vite. Check out the [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) docs for further configuration. The Vite plugin [`@osdk/widget.vite-plugin`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@osdk/widget.vite-plugin) automatically generates a `widgets.config.json` manifest file containing metadata about widgets inside this project during the build command.

## Developing

> **Note:** Before starting development, you need to deploy an initial version of your widget set. See the [Deploying](#deploying) section below to create your first deployment.

Run the following commands (or equivalent with your preferred package manager) to start a local development server and follow the instructions printed to set up developer mode in Foundry:

```sh
export FOUNDRY_TOKEN=<token>
npm run dev
```

## Deploying

A `foundry.config.json` file is included in the root of this project containing the deployment configuration to Foundry.

Run the following commands (or equivalent with your preferred package manager) to create a production build of your widgets:

```sh
export FOUNDRY_TOKEN=<token>
npm run build
```

A `.palantir/widgets.config.json` manifest file containing metadata about your widgets is created during the build.

Run the following command (or equivalent with your preferred package manager) to deploy the production build of your widgets:

```sh
npx @osdk/cli@latest widgetset deploy
```

By default the `package-json` strategy is used for determining the version for your widgets from the `version` field in this project's `package.json` file. Remember to update this field and rerun the build command to update the manifest file when deploying a new version.

If you prefer to infer the version from a git tag, you can use the `git-describe` strategy by setting the `autoVersion` field in the `foundry.config.json` file to:

```json
{
  "type": "git-describe",
  "tagPrefix": ""
}
```
