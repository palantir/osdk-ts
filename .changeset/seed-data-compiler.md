add seed data compiler. New `@osdk/seed-helpers` package exports `createSeed` and `SeedBuilder` for declaring typed seed objects and links. New `@osdk/seed-compiler` package compiles all top-level `.mts` files in a directory into a merged seed JSON (sorted by filename for deterministic output) for foundry-cli's local ontology server to load into SQLite on startup. Schema-aware validation (primary-key uniqueness, string format checks for `timestamp`/`date`/`datetime`/`long`/`decimal`) reads from `ontology-metadata.json` produced by the SDK generator, so the same compiler works against both ontology-as-code projects and imported ontologies.
