Here was your previous prompt:

I'm spinning up a purely frontend app using monaco editor and all of the foundry platform APIs. 
. I need to generate an index.d.ts file similar to
the clientTypes example below for @osdk/client . All types need to be inlined in this file - that is, there should be no
relative imports or module imports. Generate this file.



The monaco editor API (addExtraLib) expects a stringified index.d.ts file that I can mount as so:

async function handleEditorWillMount(monaco: any) {
    const clientTypes = `module "@osdk/client" {
        static createClient(...)
    }`;
    monaco.languages.typescript.typescriptDefaults.addExtraLib(
        clientTypes,
        "file:///node_modules/@osdk/client/index.d.ts",
    );
}
